# General-Purpose-Fenwick-Tree
Where to use : 
1. To find range sum query in just O(logn) time complexity for both update and query.
2. Takes just O(n) space to build.
3. To count inversions in an array. 

Formal Definitions : 
1. Range Query : You're given an array and you are given q queries which can be of 2 types, either to update a certain element or range by some value or you're given another type which asks you to calculate the sum of the range from l to r.
  For example : 1 index value
                2 l r
2. Inversion count : How far is the array from being sorted. Maximum inversion possible is array is sorted in descending order and 0 if array is sorted in ascending order.
